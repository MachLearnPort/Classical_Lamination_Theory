# MATLAB code for Classical Lamination Theory

Single monolith MATLAB script to calculate the A, B, and C stiffness matrices of a composite laminate structure. Appoximations can be based on either consituant or ply properties and orientations. Best suited for a single matrix and single fiber composites.
